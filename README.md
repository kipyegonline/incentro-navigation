### Intro

This is a recreation of [inctro](https://careers.incetro.com/) app) careers navigation menu.
I found it impressive...Ideally it involves a div with a backdrop whose positions are translated in and out of the page depending on user clicks on the menu bar... The menu bar relies on react state to add styles to the div containing the meu items..
